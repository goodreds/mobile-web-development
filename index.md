A typographic grid is a two-dimensional structure made up of a series of intersecting vertical and horizontal axes used to structure content.

The grid serves as an armature on which a designer can organize text and images in a rational, easy to absorb way.

## TECHNIQUES

Odd number of columns always
Define column based on least legacy content size/width (i.e. legacy image dimensions)
Define gutters as a division of the minimum content size (e.g. 140px/4 =35px)
Gutters should be an odd number (to allow centring of borders/lines etc)
Always go bigger than you expect to need – 20px is too small. 10px is way too small.
